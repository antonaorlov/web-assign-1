Seals live mostly in very cold, often frozen environments, and their bodies are layered in blubber to protect them from the elements.Seals in these icy regions are well equipped with strong, sharp claws on their front flippers that they dig breathing holes.   </p></td>

          <td><p>Pandas primary source of food is bamboo. They are not predators and enjoy a peaceful life. Yet, dont be mislead, They have thick, heavy skulls and their jaw muscles are attached at the top of their skulls at the sagittal crest, which gives them incredible jaw strength. Giant pandas have one of the strongest bite strengths of land mammals, ranked closely among hippopotamuses, polar bears, tigers, brown bears and lions. </p></td>
