          <td><p>Seals' ability to hear can vary between species. "Earless" seals lack an external ear flap, present on fur seals and sea lions, but they still have ears present beneath the surface of the skin. </p></td>

          <td><p>Both seals and heavy human smokers have high levels of carbon monoxide in their blood streams. While humans acquire it from burning tobacco, researchers think seals' blood carbon monoxide levels are connected to their deep dives. Exhaling is the only way for an animal to clear carbon monoxide from its body.  </p></td>

          <td><p>Research on hooded seals illustrated a drop in brain temperature by 3 degrees Celsius over the course of a fifteen minute dive, in a process designed to reduce oxygen consumption by the brain. This extends a seal's diving capacity substantially, and provides additional protection against hypoxic injury  </p></td>
